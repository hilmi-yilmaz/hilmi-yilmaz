<h1 align="left">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Hilmi</h1>
<h3 align="left">I am a Software Developer at Crisp: an online supermarket</h3>

I am writing software in React, TypeScript, PHP and NodeJs.
Currently working on improving Crisp's warehouse processes and trying to start my own SaaS called Bookerrr (in private development).

The projects on my GitHub are from my period at Codam: a programming school in the heart of Amsterdam.
